##### Headless Plane Mode
-----------------------

In this repo, the aim is to document how to run:
  * X-Plane in a Headless mode (Without the Xserver ie the graphics interface). This will enable deploying xplane on servers without 
  dedicate user interface (for example on  Amazone cloud -- bearing in mind each version deployed must have its own licence)
  * Investigate Docker set up for running xplane
