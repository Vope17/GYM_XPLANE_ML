###### Note :


  1. The simulation is regularly paused to ensure no other force (perhaps due to stability or control augmentation in XPlane) is acting on the aircraft. Doing this preserves the Markov Decision Process  of the model.
  2. Another way to do this is to just disbale control and stability augmentation in xplane. This is the more robust option. And would be incorporated in future models
