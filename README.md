## XPlane_ML_Reinforcement_Learning_Autopilot
This project documents set up of Reinforcement learning control algorithm for flight control. The simulator used is ***X-Plane***. This gives a realistic environment to work with together with parameters to keep the simulation as close to reality as possible.


## Requirement
* X Plane (Demo version for example) (main requirement)
  * [XPLane](https://www.x-plane.com/)
* XPlaneConnect (replace this with  different python udp connection file if required)
  * [XPlaneConnect](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect) [https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect]
* Tensorforce (Test Benchmark RL algorithm)
  *  [Tensorforce](https://github.com/reinforceio/tensorforce) [https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect]
* RL Algorithm (defined by your own RL algorithm)
* Lua Programming (for smooth XPlane control)
