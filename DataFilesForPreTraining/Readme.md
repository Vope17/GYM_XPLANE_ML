## Data Files collected from X Plane Simulation (Typically used for Pre-training)
___________________________________________________________________________________

The files are categorised based on the flight phase (for example landing phase) -- the name of the file will reflect which flight phase data it is.
This could be extended to relfect the type of aircraft too. The aim of these training data is to pretrain the models or 
to find the reward or action space approximator or distribution function. This gives the agent some priors ( or "clues") about the
task.
